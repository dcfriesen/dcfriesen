- 👋 Hi, I’m @dcfriesen. You won't see too much here, since I'm busy helping law enforcement catch bad guys. I'm mostly working with GitLab in my current position as a Systems Integration Engineero II with a industry leading Identity and Security company in their biometrics division. I'm currently working as a fullstack backend heavy bad-ass in the linux, Java, XML, git, GitLab, JavaScript space (to name only a few, since I'm tech/tool agnostic).
- 👀 I’m interested in all sorts of things. My biggest interests are faith, family, and freedom, solving problems (of course), and vacations at the beach. 🗿🌋🏝🏴‍☠️☠️🍹
